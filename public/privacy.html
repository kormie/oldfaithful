      <h4>Jot Locker, LLC ("Jot Locker", "our", "we", or "us") respects the privacy of the users of the <a class="green" href="http://jotlocker.com">jotlocker.com</a> website (the "Website") and the services made available on the Website (the Website and such services are referred to as the "Service"). To that effect, we have instituted the following Privacy Policy:</h4>
      <p>Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect your personal information, how we handle and protect this information, and what you can do to help protect this information. We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time to accurately reflect how we gather and manage your information. All changes to this Privacy Policy are effective upon posting to this Website without notice to you.</p>

      <p><span class="underline">Scope and Third Party Sites</span>. Our Privacy Policy covers all of Jot Locker. It does not, however, apply to entities that Jot Locker does not own or control, such as applications and websites using Facebook Platform. By using or accessing Jot Locker, you agree to our privacy practices outlined here. We do not own or operate the applications or websites that you use through Facebook (such as games and utilities). The Website contains links to other websites. Jot Locker has no control over and is not responsible for the privacy policies or content of such sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information.  This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected by the Service.</p>
      <p><span class="underline">Age Restrictions</span>. If you are under age 13, please do not provide any personal information about yourself to us or attempt to register for Jot Locker. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from a child under age 13, please contact us through email at <a class="green" href="mailto:'Jot Locker Security'<security@jotlocker.com>">security@jotlocker.com</a>. We strongly recommend that minors 13 years of age or older ask their parents for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet and we encourage parents to teach their children about safe internet use practices.</p>
      <p><span class="underline">Information You Provide To Jot Locker</span>. When you sign up for Jot Locker you provide us with your name, date of birth, and email address; or, if you sign up for Jot Locker through Facebook, we collect any registration information you provide to Facebook and we may collect other public information about you that is posted to Facebook. You will also be able to add a picture of yourself. In some cases we may ask for additional information for security reasons or to provide specific services to you. Once you register you can provide other information about yourself, such as your current city, hometown and contacts. You can also provide personal information about yourself, such as your classes, courses, assignments, tasks and appointments. We may retain the details of transactions or payments you make on Jot Locker. If you do not want us to store your payment source account number, you can remove it through the user preferences of the Website.  Even after you remove information from your profile or delete your account, copies of that information may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent it has been shared with others, it was otherwise distributed pursuant to your privacy settings, or it was copied or stored by other users. If you use an external source to publish information to Jot Locker (such as a mobile application or Facebook), you should check the privacy setting for that post, as it is set by that external source.</p>
      <p><span class="underline">Content</span>. One of the primary reasons people use Jot Locker is to share content with others. Examples include when you upload your class notes, outlines and Viewpoints, write a note, or send someone a message. If you do not want us to store metadata associated with content you share on Facebook (such as photos), please remove the metadata before uploading the content. Some of the content you share may show up on your friends' home pages. You understand that information might be reshared or copied by other users.</p>
      <p><span class="underline">Tell-a-Friend</span>. We offer a Tell-a-Friend feature that allows you to inform a friend about our Website. If you elect to use our Tell-a-Friend feature for informing a friend about our Website, we ask you for your friend's name and email address. The Tell-a-Friend feature will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the Website. We store this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email.</p>
      <p><span class="underline">Cookies</span>. Our Service is set up to automatically collect anonymous information about visitors. When you access Jot Locker from a computer, mobile phone, or other device, we may collect information from that device about your browser type, location, and Internet Protocol address, as well as the pages you visit. We also gather information through the use of "cookies." We use cookies to help us understand our visitors and traffic patterns to our site; to store your login ID (but never your password) to make it easier for you to login whenever you come back to Jot Locker. You can remove or block cookies using the settings in your browser, but in some cases that may impact your ability to use Jot Locker. </p>
      <p><span class="underline">Collection and Use of Aggregated Information</span>. We create aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns. These aggregated statistics are used internally to better provide services to our users and may also be provided to advertisers, sponsors, and partners but again, they contain no individual personal information and cannot be used to gather such information. This allows our advertisers, partners, and sponsors to advertise more effectively, and allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent to their needs. Because we don't track the usage patterns of individual users, an advertiser, partner, or sponsor will never know that a specific user clicked their ad. 
      <p><span class="underline">Exporting Information</span>. You (and those you make your information available to) may use tools like RSS feeds, mobile phone address book applications, or copy and paste functions, to capture, export (and in some cases, import) information from Jot Locker, including your information and information about you.
      <p><span class="underline">How We Use Your Information</span>. We use the information we collect to provide our services and features to you, to measure and improve those services and features, and to provide you with customer support. We use the information to prevent potentially illegal activities. These efforts may on occasion result in a temporary or permanent suspension or termination of some functions for some users. We may contact you with service-related announcements from time to time. You may opt out of all communications except essential updates on your Preferences page. We don't share your information with advertisers without your consent. We allow advertisers to choose the characteristics of users who will see their advertisements and we may use any of the non-personally identifiable attributes we have collected (including information you may have decided not to show to other users, such as your birth year or other sensitive personal information or preferences) to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements.  Even though we do not share your information with advertisers without your consent, when you click on or otherwise interact with an advertisement there is a possibility that the advertiser may place a cookie in your browser and note that it meets the criteria they selected.
      <p><span class="underline">How Your Information is Shared</span>. Jot Locker is about sharing content with others. We share your content with third parties when we believe the sharing is permitted by you, reasonably necessary to offer our services, or when legally required to do so. 
      <p><span class="underline">Legal Disclosures</span>. If Jot Locker is required by law or legal process, Jot Locker will disclose or provide access to your information to such government or judicial authority as specified by such law or legal process. We may also share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to prevent fraud or other illegal activity, to prevent imminent bodily harm, or to protect ourselves and you from people violating our Terms of Use. 
      <p><span class="underline">How We Protect Information</span>.  We keep your account information on a secured server behind a firewall. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card numbers and passwords), we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We also use automated and social measures to enhance security, and we may limit use of site features in response to possible signs of abuse, may remove inappropriate content or links to illegal content, and may suspend or disable accounts for violations of our Terms of Use.
      <p><span class="underline">Violations of this Policy</span>. Jot Locker will terminate your access to the Service if, under appropriate circumstances, Jot Locker determines you violated this Privacy Policy.
      <p><span class="underline">Transfer in the Event of Sale or Change of Control</span>. If the ownership of all or substantially all of our business changes, of if Jot Locker is subject to a merger, consolidation or other reorganization, we may transfer your information to the new owner so that the service can continue to operate. In such a case, your information would remain subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy.
